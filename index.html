        I think I'll start off with an apology. I'm sorry I didn't do anything special on our actual anniversary. I'm sorry I was busy all day and didn't make time for you. I'm sorry that I take you for granted sometimes and forget that I need to put in effort to make our relationship good.<br> I wanted to type out a letter or whatever this would be so I could send it to you because sometimes I have a hard time actually writing stuff because I can't get it all down.<br>
